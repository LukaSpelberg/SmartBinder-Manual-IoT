# SmartBinder-Manual-IoT

## Introduction 
For this manual I'll guide you through the process of connecting your ESP8266 board to a database and ultimately to the app, to make your card collection transition seamlessly from physical to digital! We will make use of ArduinoIDE to write the code for the board, and then also make a simple app to see & track all your cards. This guide will also cover potential errors you could experience. This way we will all finish this guide with the same end result, no matter your level of coding skills! So lets start off with the parts you will need. 

## Parts. 
For this guide we will use the following items
- A nodeMCU esp8266 board.
- A LEDstrip
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- A button module or distance sensor (nog kiezen welke gebruiken)

## Step 1 - Set up 


## Step 2 - Creating a database


## Step 3 - Code for the ESP8266


## Step 4 - Code for the website.
